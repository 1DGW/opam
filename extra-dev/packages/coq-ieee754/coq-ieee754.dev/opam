synopsis: "A formalisation of the IEEE754 norm on floating-point arithmetic."
description: """
The IEEE754 norm was born in 1985 and is now used in all
microprocessors. Here is a full formalistion in Coq of this norm,
including denormalized numbers, infinite values and NaNs.

This work can be used as a basis for
specification and proof of floating-point algorithms, e.g. to compute
the exponential. Another exciting topic would be to relate that work
to the axiomatization of real numbers of Micela Mayero, since this
formalization do not use real numbers.

See http://www.lri.fr/~loisel/rapport-stage-dea.ps.gz for a complete
discussion (in french) of this work."""
