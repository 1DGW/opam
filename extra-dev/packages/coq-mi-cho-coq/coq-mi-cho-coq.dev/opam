synopsis: "A specification of Michelson in Coq to prove properties about smart contracts in Tezos"
description: """
Michelson is a language for writing smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.
This package provides a Coq encoding of the syntax and semantics of Michelson,
automatically generated by the Ott tool. Also included is a framework called Mi-Cho-Coq
for reasoning about Michelson programs in Coq using a weakest precondition calculus."""
