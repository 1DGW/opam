synopsis: "New Up-to Techniques for Weak Bisimulation."
description: """
This contribution is the formalisation of a paper that appeared in
Proc. of ICALP 2005: "Up-to Techniques for Weak Bisimulation".
First we define a framework for defining up-to techniques for weak
bisimulation in a modular way. Then we prove the correctness of some
new up-to techniques, based on termination guarantees. Notably, a
generalisation of Newman's Lemma to commutation results is
established."""
