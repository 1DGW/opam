description:"""
Albert is an intermediate smart contract programming language
targeting Michelson, the language for the Tezos blockchain. Albert is
an imperative language with variables and records, abstracting the
Michelson stack. The intent of Albert is to serve as a compilation
target for high-level smart contract programming languages. The linear
type system of Albert ensures that an Albert program, compiled to the
stack-based Michelson language, properly consumes all stack values.

This package contains the ott specification of the language, the
Albert compiler targeting Michelson written in Coq and extracted to OCaml.
