synopsis: "Ring properties for square matrices ."
description: """
This contribution contains an operational formalization of square matrices.
(m,n)-Matrices are represented as vectors of length n. Each vector
(a row) is itself a vector whose length is m.
Vectors are actually implemented as dependent lists.

We define basic operations for this datatype (addition, product, neutral
elements O_n and I_n). We then prove the ring properties for these
operations. The development uses Coq modules to specify the interface
(the ring structure properties) as a signature.

This development deals with dependent types and partial functions.
Most of the functions are defined by dependent case analysis
and some functions such as getting a column require
the use of preconditions (to check whether we are within the
bounds of the matrix)."""
