DRAFT Mathematical Components Library on Analysis

This library contains a DRAFT and UNSTABLE embryo of an analyis
library inspired from the Coquelicot Library, but compatible with
the Mathematical Components library. It contains libraries about
topology, filters, Bachmann-Landay notations and differentiation.
