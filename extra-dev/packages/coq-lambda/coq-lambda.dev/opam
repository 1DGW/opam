description: """
We present the complete development in Gallina of the
residual theory of beta-reduction in pure lambda-calculus. The main
result is the Prism Theorem, and its corollary Lévy's Cube Lemma, a
strong form of the parallel-moves lemma, itself a key step towards the
confluence theorem and its usual corollaries (Church-Rosser,
uniqueness of normal forms)."""
