  "Historical examples developed in the (pure) Calculus of Constructions ."
description: """
This is a collection of historical examples developed in
system CoC that implemented Coquand's Calculus of Constructions.
Newman.v and Tarski.v originate in version 1.10, Manna.v and
Format.v are from version 4.3. Their evolution to the Calculus of
Inductive Constructions (up to Coq V6.3) are in MannaCIC.v and
FormatCIC.v. (Collection by Hugo Herbelin.)"""
