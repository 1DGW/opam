synopsis: "A small library to do epsilon - N reasoning"
description: """
The package contains a package to reasoning with big enough objects
(mostly natural numbers). This package is essentially for backward
compatibility purposes as `bigenough` will be subsumed by the near
tactics. The formalization is based on the Mathematical Components
library."""
