synopsis: "Exponentiation algorithms following addition chains in Coq"
description: """
Addition chains are algorithms for computations of the p-th power of some x, 
with the least number of multiplications possible. This development provides
a few implementations of addition chains in Coq, including proofs of their
correctness."""
