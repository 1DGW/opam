synopsis: "Strongly connected component algorithms by Tarjan and Kosaraju using Coq and MathComp"
description: """
This development contains formalizations and correctness proofs using Coq and the Mathematical
Components library of algorithms originally due to Kosaraju and Tarjan for finding strongly
connected components in finite graphs. It also contains a verified implementation of topological
sorting with extended guarantees for acyclic graphs."""
