synopsis: "Plugin for generating parametricity statements to perform refinement proofs"
description: """
A Coq plugin providing commands for generating parametricity statements.
Typical applications of such statements are in data refinement proofs.
Note that the plugin is still in an experimental state - it is not very user
friendly (lack of good error messages) and still contains bugs. But it
is usable enough to "translate" a large chunk of the standard library."""
