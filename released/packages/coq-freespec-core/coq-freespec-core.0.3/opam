synopsis: "A framework for implementing and certifying impure computations in Coq"
description: """
FreeSpec is a framework for the Coq proof assistant which allows to
implement and specify impure computations. This is the core of the
framework: it provides the foundation of the formalism, based on the
freer monad, the reasoning theory and tactics to automate the
reasoning.
