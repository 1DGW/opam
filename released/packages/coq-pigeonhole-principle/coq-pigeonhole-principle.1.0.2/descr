This library provides a stand-alone proof of the Pigeonhole
principle. The Pigeonhole principle is a fundamental theorem that
is used widely in Computer Science and Combinatorics, it asserts
that if you put n things into m containers, and n > m, then at
least one of the containers contains more than one thing.

The Coq Standard Library does not contain a proof of the Pigeonhole
principle. In addition, the Coq Package Index only contains one
other proof of the Pigeonhole principle. This proof is contained
in the CoLoR library in a module defining a predicate named occur.

The proof given by the CoLoR library is not a stand-alone proof
and depends on several other functions and predicates provided by
the library. Accordingly, a developer cannot use this proof without
including the entire library and familiarizing themselves with the
definitions and notations defined therein.

In contrast, in this library, we present a stand-alone proof that
relies solely on the Coq Standard Library. A developer looking for
a proof of the Pigeonhole principle can include this proof directly
without any additional complications.
