Proof of the Four Color Theorem

This library contains a formalized proof of the Four Color Theorem, along
with the theories needed to support stating and then proving the Theorem.
  This includes an axiomatization of the setoid of classical real numbers,
basic plane topology definitions, and a theory of combinatorial hypermaps.
