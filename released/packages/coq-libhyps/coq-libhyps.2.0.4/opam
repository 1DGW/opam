description: "
This library defines a set of tactics to manipulate hypothesis
individually or by group. In particular it allows applying a tactic on
each hypothesis of a goal, or only on *new* hypothesis after some
tactic. Examples of manipulations: automatic renaming, subst, revert,
or any tactic expecting a hypothesis name as argument.

It also provides the especialize tactic to ease forward reasoning by
instantianting one, several or all premisses of a hypothesis.
