synopsis: "Abel - Ruffini's theorem"
description: """
This repository contains a proof of Abel - Galois Theorem
(equivalence between being solvable by radicals and having a
solvable Galois group) and Abel - Ruffini Theorem (unsolvability of
quintic equations) in the Coq proof-assistant and using the
Mathematical Components library."""
