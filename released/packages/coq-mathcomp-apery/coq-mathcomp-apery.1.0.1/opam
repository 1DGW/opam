synopsis: "A formally verified proof in Coq, by computer algebra, that ζ(3) is irrational"
description: """
This project contains a formal proof that the real number ζ(3),
also known as Apéry's constant, is irrational. It follows roughly
Apéry's original sketch of a proof. However, the recurrence
relations constituting the crux of the proof have been guessed by a
computer algebra program (in this case in Maple/Algolib). These
relations are formally checked a posteriori, so that Coq's kernel
remains the sole trusted code base."""
