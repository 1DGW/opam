synopsis: "A work-in-progress language and compiler for verified low-level programming (compiler part)"
description: """
bedrock2 is a low-level systems programming language. This language is
equipped with a simple program logic for proving correctness of the
programs.  This package includes a verified compiler targeting RISC-V
from this language.

The project has similar goals as bedrock, but uses a different design.
No code is shared between bedrock and bedrock2.
