# Checked it also works for 4.02.1, 4.03.0, 4.04.2, 4.06.0
# Version 4.02.0 would work but with severe performance issues in compilation time
# Fails in 4.04.2 because of a conflict with OCaml files matching.ml and lexer.ml
# (however this conflict is apparently dependent on the order of files
# in some table, so it might succeeds with further versions of OCaml)
